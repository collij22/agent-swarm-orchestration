## 📋 Current Test Architecture Analysis

Based on my deep analysis of the test suite, here's how it currently works:

### 🏗️ **Test Infrastructure Components**

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/test_agents.py`)
   - Tests individual SFA agents with mock/live modes
   - Validates model selection and cost optimization
   - Performance benchmarking capabilities

2. **Enhanced Mock Client** (`lib/mock_anthropic_enhanced.py`)
   - **File System Simulator**: Creates actual temp files during testing
   - **Requirement Tracker**: Tracks completion percentages (0-100%)
   - **Controlled Failures**: Configurable failure rates for robustness testing
   - **Realistic Responses**: Agent-specific patterns generating actual code/docs

3. **E2E Workflow Tests** (`tests/test_section10_e2e_workflows.py`)
   - **6 workflow types**: API service, full-stack webapp, AI solution, legacy migration, performance-critical, microservices
   - **Agent orchestration**: Sequential phases with parallel execution
   - **Context passing**: File tracking and inter-agent communication
   - **Success validation**: Completion thresholds, file counts, feature verification

4. **Session Management Integration**
   - Session creation and tracking throughout workflows
   - Requirement coverage analysis with traceability
   - Quality validation with measurable completion metrics

### 🔄 **Current Workflow Execution Pattern**

```python
# Real workflow execution mirrors this pattern:
1. Load agent configs from .claude/agents/*.md files
2. Create AgentContext with requirements
3. Execute agents in workflow-defined sequence
4. Pass context between agents (files, decisions, artifacts)
5. Validate success criteria and completion percentage
6. Generate session analysis report
```

   ```

3. **Feedback Loops**
   ```
   quality-guardian → rapid-builder (retry with fixes)
   performance-optimizer → database-expert (schema optimization)
   ```

4. **Resource Sharing**
   ```
   Test: Multiple agents requesting same artifacts
   Test: Version conflicts in shared dependencies
   Test: Context size management with large projects
   ```

### 🎯 **Specific Test Cases for Agent Tools**

def test_dependency_check_tool():
    # Test: Agent B requires artifact from Agent A
    # Verify: dependency_check correctly identifies missing artifacts
    
def test_request_artifact_tool():
    # Test: Agent requests specific file from previous agent
    # Verify: File contents retrieved correctly
    
def test_verify_deliverables_tool():
    # Test: Critical files exist and are valid
    # Verify: Size checks, content validation, accessibility
```

**Quality Validation Tools:**
```python
def test_validate_requirements_integration():
    # Test: Full requirement validation with real project
    # Verify: Completion percentage accuracy vs manual review
    
def test_test_endpoints_tool():
    # Test: API endpoint availability during development
    # Verify: Correct status codes, response validation
    
def test_validate_docker_tool():
    # Test: Docker configuration validation and build
    # Verify: Multi-stage builds, security best practices
```

### 🎪 **Mock Mode Enhancement for E2E Testing**

**Advanced Mock Behaviors:**
```python
class EnhancedE2EMockClient:
    def simulate_realistic_delays():
        # Vary response times based on agent complexity
        
    def inject_contextual_failures():
        # Fail based on project complexity, not random chance
        
    def track_cross_agent_dependencies():
        # Monitor file usage between agents
        
    def validate_requirement_progression():
        # Ensure requirements are addressed in logical order
```
