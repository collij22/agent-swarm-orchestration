  Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - Intelligent Tool Interception Layer [COMPLETED ✅]

  Objective: Create a middleware that intercepts, validates, and fixes ALL tool calls before execution

  1.1 Create INTELLIGENT_ORCHESTRATOR.py

  - Universal Tool Interceptor
    - Intercept ALL tool calls, not just write_file
    - Pre-validate parameters before execution
    - Auto-generate missing content based on context
    - Track tool call patterns for learning
  - Content Generation Engine
  content_generators = {
      '.md': generate_markdown_content,
      '.json': generate_json_content,
      '.py': generate_python_content,
      '.yaml': generate_yaml_content,
      '.tsx': generate_react_content,
      # ... comprehensive file type coverage
  }
  - Context-Aware Content Generation
    - Parse agent's reasoning to understand intent
    - Extract key information from project requirements
    - Generate REAL content, not placeholders
    - Use templates with actual data

  Phase 2: Loop Breaking & Error Recovery

  2.1 Implement Failure Pattern Detection

  - Loop Detector
    - Track last 5 tool calls per agent
    - Detect when same error occurs 2+ times
    - Automatically switch strategy after 2 failures
  - Progressive Recovery Strategies
  recovery_strategies = [
      "fix_missing_parameters",     # Attempt 1: Add missing params
      "regenerate_with_examples",    # Attempt 2: Show examples
      "force_structured_output",     # Attempt 3: Use structured format
      "bypass_agent_create_directly" # Attempt 4: Create file ourselves
  ]

  2.2 Smart Retry Logic

  - Maximum 2 attempts per approach
  - Change strategy, not just retry
  - Track what worked for future reference

  Phase 3: Enhanced Agent Communication Protocol

  3.1 Structured Agent Responses

  - Mandatory Response Format
  AgentResponse = {
      "status": "success|partial|failed",
      "deliverables": [
          {"type": "file", "path": "...", "verified": true}
      ],
      "missing_requirements": [...],
      "handoff_data": {...},
      "next_agent_recommendation": "..."
  }

  3.2 Deliverable Verification

  - Post-execution Validation
    - Check all mentioned files exist
    - Verify file size > 100 bytes
    - Validate JSON/YAML syntax
    - Ensure no "TODO" placeholders

  Phase 4: Agent Prompt Engineering

  4.1 Universal Agent Instructions

  UNIVERSAL_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS = """
  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN TASK REJECTION:

  1. FILE CREATION RULES:
     - ALWAYS include content parameter with ACTUAL content
     - NEVER write "TODO" or placeholders
     - Content must be complete and functional

  2. TOOL USAGE:
     write_file(
         file_path="exact/path/to/file.ext",
         content="COMPLETE ACTUAL CONTENT HERE"
     )

  3. DELIVERABLES:
     - Every file you mention MUST be created
     - Every file created MUST have real content
     - Report exact paths of created files

  4. ERROR HANDLING:
     - If you get an error, CHANGE your approach
     - Do NOT retry the same failed command
     - Read error messages and adapt

  5. COMMUNICATION:
     - Report what you ACTUALLY created
     - List files with their exact paths
     - Confirm each deliverable exists
  """

  4.2 File-Type Specific Examples

  - Provide working examples for EVERY file type
  - Show correct parameter structure
  - Include sample content that works

  Phase 5: Intelligent Orchestration Flow

  5.1 Main Orchestrator Logic

  class IntelligentOrchestrator:
      def __init__(self):
          self.interceptor = UniversalInterceptor()
          self.loop_breaker = LoopBreaker()
          self.content_generator = ContentGenerator()
          self.verifier = DeliverableVerifier()

      def execute_agent(self, agent, task):
          # Pre-execution setup
          self.interceptor.register_agent(agent)
          self.loop_breaker.reset(agent)

          # Execute with monitoring
          while not task.complete and attempts < max_attempts:
              response = agent.execute(task)

              # Check for loops
              if self.loop_breaker.detect_loop(agent, response):
                  self.loop_breaker.break_loop(agent)

              # Verify deliverables
              missing = self.verifier.check_deliverables(response)
              if missing:
                  self.content_generator.create_missing(missing)

              # Validate quality
              if self.verifier.has_placeholders(response):
                  self.content_generator.replace_placeholders()

          return self.verifier.final_report()

  Phase 6: Quality Assurance & Monitoring

  6.1 Real-time Monitoring Dashboard

  - Track agent progress in real-time
  - Show files created vs files mentioned
  - Display error patterns and recovery attempts
  - Alert on infinite loops

  6.2 Automatic Quality Checks

  - No files with < 100 bytes
  - No "TODO" in production files
  - All JSON/YAML must be valid
  - All mentioned files must exist

  Phase 7: Implementation Commands

  7.1 Primary Files to Create

  1. INTELLIGENT_ORCHESTRATOR.py - Main orchestration system
  2. lib/interceptor.py - Universal tool interceptor
  3. lib/content_generator.py - Smart content generation
  4. lib/loop_breaker.py - Loop detection and breaking
  5. lib/deliverable_verifier.py - Quality assurance
  6. RUN_INTELLIGENT.bat - Execution script

  7.2 Test Commands

  # Run the intelligent orchestrator
  RUN_INTELLIGENT.bat

  # Test with specific requirements
  python INTELLIGENT_ORCHESTRATOR.py --requirements quickshop.yaml --verbose

  # Verify all deliverables
  python verify_deliverables.py projects/quickshop-mvp-intelligent/

  Success Metrics

  The plan succeeds when:
  1. ✅ 100% of mentioned files are created
  2. ✅ 0 files contain "TODO" or placeholders
  3. ✅ No agent retries same error > 2 times
  4. ✅ All JSON/YAML files are valid
  5. ✅ File sizes > 1KB for documentation
  6. ✅ Clear handoff data between agents
  7. ✅ Complete project structure created

  Risk Mitigation

  1. If agent still fails after 4 strategies → Orchestrator creates file directly
  2. If content generation fails → Use comprehensive templates
  3. If verification fails → Auto-fix and document issue
  4. If communication breaks → Fallback to artifact sharing

  This plan ensures:
  - No placeholders ever reach production
  - Infinite loops are impossible
  - All deliverables are verified
  - Agents communicate effectively
  - System self-heals when issues occur
