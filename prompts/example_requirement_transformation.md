# Example Requirement Enhancement Transformation

## Original Basic Requirement

```
I want to build a platform where freelancers can showcase their portfolios and clients 
can hire them for projects. It should have a rating system, secure payments through 
Stripe, and a messaging system for communication. Freelancers should be able to set 
their hourly rates and availability. I prefer using React for the frontend.

## How This Enhances Agent Execution

1. **Clear Requirements** → Agents know exactly what to build
2. **Technical Specs** → Architecture decisions are pre-made
3. **Data Models** → Database-expert has clear schema
4. **Integrations** → API-integrator knows which services to connect
5. **Success Metrics** → Quality-guardian has clear testing targets
6. **Security Requirements** → Built-in compliance from the start

## Result

This enhanced requirement will enable the 15-agent swarm to:
- Work in parallel on independent components
- Make consistent technical decisions
- Build with security and performance in mind
- Deliver a production-ready MVP in 3-4 weeks
- Automatically activate relevant MCP servers (Stripe, Browser, Ref)
- Generate comprehensive documentation and tests
