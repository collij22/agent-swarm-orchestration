## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.x to 2.0

1. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install openai google-generativeai sentence-transformers
   ```

2. **Configure Multi-LLM Support**
   ```bash
   python setup_multi_llm.py
   ```

3. **Update .env File**
   Add new API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
   ```

4. **Launch Enhanced Dashboard**
   ```bash
   python web/start_with_cost_tracking.py
   ```

5. **Run Security Audit**
   ```bash
   python sfa/sfa_security_auditor.py --project-dir .
   ```

### Breaking Changes in 2.0
- `.env` file structure changed to support multiple providers
- `AnthropicAgentRunner` replaced with `EnhancedAgentRunner`
- Dashboard configuration updated for cost tracking

### Migration Path
1. Backup existing `.env` file
2. Run `setup_multi_llm.py` to migrate configuration
3. Update any custom scripts using old runner classes
4. Test with mock mode before production use
