## Enhancement Plan for Agent Swarm Project

Based on my analysis, here are potential enhancements to consider:

### 1. **Cost Optimization**
- Implement intelligent model selection (use Haiku for simple tasks, upgrade to Sonnet/Opus only when needed)
- Add response caching to avoid redundant API calls
- Implement token usage optimization strategies

### 2. **Testing Infrastructure**
- Create a comprehensive test suite for the agent system
- Add integration tests for agent coordination
- Implement mock API responses for development/testing without costs

### 3. **User Experience**
- Add a CLI wizard for project setup and requirements gathering
- Create templates for common project types (e-commerce, SaaS, mobile app)
- Improve error messages and recovery suggestions

### 4. **Additional Agents**
- **security-auditor**: Specialized security scanning and vulnerability detection
- **data-scientist**: ML model development and data pipeline creation
- **mobile-specialist**: React Native/Flutter mobile app development

### 5. **Integration Improvements**
- Add support for other LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, local models)
- Implement GitLab/Bitbucket CI/CD integration (currently GitHub-focused)
- Add support for alternative cloud providers (GCP, Azure)

### 6. **Monitoring Enhancements**
- Add cost tracking and budget alerts to the web dashboard
- Implement agent performance benchmarking
- Create automated performance regression detection

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any of these enhancements?
