# Comprehensive Fix Plan for Agent Swarm Issues

## 1. Fix Automated Debugger Registration
**Problem**: Automated-debugger agent exists but isn't being loaded
**Solution**:
- Check if the automated-debugger.md has correct metadata format
- Ensure the agent name in the file matches "automated-debugger" exactly
- Add explicit registration check and fallback in orchestrate_enhanced.py
- Log which agents are successfully loaded for debugging

## 2. Fix Write File Content Parameter Issue
**Problem**: Agents repeatedly fail to provide content parameter
**Solution**:
- Update the write_file tool description to be more explicit about required parameters
- Add a pre-validation in the agent runtime that catches this before execution
- Enhance agent prompts to explicitly state both file_path AND content must be provided together
- Add automatic content generation for ALL cases where content is missing
- Make the error non-fatal so agents can retry

## 3. Fix Character Encoding Issues
**Problem**: Unicode characters cause charmap codec errors on Windows
**Solution**:
- Force UTF-8 encoding throughout the entire pipeline
- Replace problematic Unicode characters (✅) with ASCII equivalents ([OK], [x], etc.)
- Add encoding='utf-8' to ALL file operations (read, write, log)
- Set Python's default encoding to UTF-8 at startup
- Add fallback to ASCII with character replacement for any remaining issues

## 4. Improve Build Validation Feedback
**Problem**: Build validation fails without actionable details
**Solution**:
- Capture and log the actual compilation/build command output
- Parse specific error messages from build tools
- Provide line numbers and file paths for errors
- Generate suggested fixes based on common error patterns
- Store validation results in a structured format for the debugger

## 5. Strengthen Error Recovery System
**Problem**: Error recovery exists but doesn't trigger properly
**Solution**:
- Make write_file errors non-breaking (continue execution)
- Track error patterns across agent executions
- Implement progressive retry strategies (immediate → with hints → different agent)
- Add error pattern detection to trigger appropriate recovery
- Create error recovery dashboard for monitoring

## 6. Add Comprehensive Testing
**Solution**:
- Create test cases for write_file with missing parameters
- Test automated-debugger registration and invocation
- Test Unicode handling across different platforms
- Add integration tests for the full error recovery pipeline
- Implement continuous validation during execution

## Implementation Priority:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix automated-debugger registration (enables self-healing)
2. **HIGH**: Fix write_file parameter handling (prevents most errors)
3. **HIGH**: Fix encoding issues (prevents runtime failures)
4. **MEDIUM**: Improve validation feedback (helps debugging)
5. **MEDIUM**: Strengthen error recovery (improves reliability)
6. **LOW**: Add comprehensive testing (long-term stability)

This plan addresses all root causes and will prevent these issues from recurring.
