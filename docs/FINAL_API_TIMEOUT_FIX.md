# Final API Mode Timeout Fix - Complete Solution

## Root Cause Analysis

After extensive debugging, the root cause was identified:

### The Problem
The ecommerce test runs **7-8 different agents**, each potentially taking 5-10 minutes in API mode:
1. **rapid-builder** - Creates backend structure (~4-5 minutes)
2. **api-integrator** - Sets up external services (~1-2 minutes)  
3. **ai-specialist** - Implements AI features (~8-10 minutes)
4. **frontend-specialist** - Creates React frontend (~5-8 minutes)
5. **database-expert** - Sets up database schema (~3-5 minutes)
6. **quality-guardian** - Runs tests and validation (~5-8 minutes)
7. **performance-optimizer** - Optimizes code (~3-5 minutes)
8. **devops-engineer** - Sets up deployment (~3-5 minutes)

**Total time needed: 30-50 minutes** for all agents to complete

### Why Previous Fixes Failed
- We increased timeout to 15 minutes (900s) thinking that would be enough
- But with 7-8 agents running sequentially, 15 minutes only covers 2-3 agents
- The 4th agent (frontend-specialist) was still running when the 15-minute timeout hit

## Complete Solution

### 1. Subprocess Timeout (tests/phase5_validation/run_tests.py)
```python
if self.api_mode:
    # API mode needs 45 minutes for all agents
    timeout_seconds = 2700  # 45 minutes
    print(f"[INFO] Using {timeout_seconds}s timeout ({timeout_seconds/60:.0f} minutes) for API mode")
else:
    timeout_seconds = test_config.get("estimated_time", 300)
```

### 2. Agent Timeout (lib/orchestration_enhanced.py)
```python
# Each agent gets 8 minutes in API mode
timeout_seconds = 480 if is_api_mode else 30
```

### 3. HTTP Client Timeout (lib/agent_runtime.py)
```python
timeout=httpx.Timeout(
    connect=10.0,
    read=120.0,   # 2 minutes for Claude responses
    write=10.0,
    pool=10.0
)
```

## Timeout Hierarchy

```
Test Level:      2700 seconds (45 minutes) total
Agent Level:     480 seconds (8 minutes) per agent
HTTP Level:      120 seconds (2 minutes) per API call
Validation:      30 seconds for API key validation
```

## Why This Works

1. **45 minutes total** gives enough time for 7-8 agents to run sequentially
2. **8 minutes per agent** allows each agent to make multiple Claude API calls
3. **2 minutes per API call** handles slow Claude responses
4. **Graceful termination** ensures clean shutdown if timeout is reached

## Test Execution Timeline

Based on actual session logs:
```
14:19:54 - Test starts
14:24:22 - rapid-builder completes (4.5 min)
14:25:14 - api-integrator completes (1 min)
14:33:49 - ai-specialist completes (8.5 min)
14:34:54 - frontend-specialist in progress (killed at 15 min timeout)
-- With 45 min timeout, would continue --
~14:42:00 - frontend-specialist completes (~7 min)
~14:47:00 - database-expert completes (~5 min)
~14:54:00 - quality-guardian completes (~7 min)
~14:58:00 - performance-optimizer completes (~4 min)
~15:02:00 - devops-engineer completes (~4 min)
Total: ~42 minutes for all agents
```

## Running the Test

```bash
python tests/phase5_validation/run_tests.py --test ecommerce --api-mode --verbose
```

The test will now:
1. Display: `[INFO] Using 2700s timeout (45 minutes) for API mode`
2. Run all agents to completion
3. Either succeed or report actual timeout after 45 minutes

## Important Notes

1. **Be patient** - The test will take 30-45 minutes to complete
2. **Monitor progress** - Check session logs to see which agents are running
3. **API costs** - This will make many Claude API calls (50-100+)
4. **Resources** - Ensure stable internet connection for the duration

## Troubleshooting

If the test still times out after 45 minutes:
1. Check which agent is taking too long in session logs
2. Consider if you have API rate limits
3. Verify your API key has sufficient credits
4. Check Claude API status for any service issues

## Alternative: Reduce Agent Count

If 45 minutes is too long, you can create a simpler test that runs fewer agents:
- Modify the requirements YAML to include only 2-3 agents
- This would complete in 10-15 minutes
- Still tests the system but with less comprehensive coverage
