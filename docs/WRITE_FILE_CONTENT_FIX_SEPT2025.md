# Write File Content Parameter Fix - September 2025

## Issue Summary

The ai-specialist agent was repeatedly failing with `write_file called without content parameter` errors. Investigation revealed the agent was calling write_file with only `reasoning` and `file_path` parameters but missing the required `content` parameter.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The ai-specialist agent was attempting to split file creation into two steps:
1. First, calling write_file with just the file path
2. Then, trying to add content separately

This pattern caused:
- Repeated error messages: "Let me create the actual implementation file content separately"
- Multiple placeholder files being generated
- Agent stuck in retry loops

### Contributing Factors
1. **Token Limits**: The agent may have been hitting token limits when trying to generate large files
2. **Prompt Structure**: The agent prompt didn't explicitly emphasize including content in write_file calls
3. **Error Recovery**: While errors were being caught, the feedback wasn't clear enough to guide correction

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Feedback (agent_runtime.py:471-479)
```python
error_guidance = (
    f"Error: {error_msg}\n\n"
    "IMPORTANT: The write_file tool requires both 'file_path' and 'content' parameters.\n"
    "Please call write_file again with BOTH parameters:\n"
    "- file_path: The path where to save the file\n"
    "- content: The actual content to write to the file\n\n"
    "Example:\n"
    "write_file(file_path='path/to/file.py', content='actual file content here')\n\n"
    "Do NOT try to create content in a separate step. Include it directly in the write_file call."
)
```

### 2. Improved Agent Prompt Instructions (agent_runtime.py:757-758)
Added explicit instructions to all agent prompts:
```
3. IMPORTANT: When using write_file, ALWAYS include both 'file_path' AND 'content' parameters in the same call
4. Never try to split file creation into multiple steps - provide the complete content immediately
```

### 3. Better Warning Logging (agent_runtime.py:660-663)
Changed from `log_reasoning` to `log_warning` with clearer message:
```python
self.logger.log_warning(
    agent_name or "unknown",
    f"WARNING: Generated placeholder content for {file_path}",
    "Agent must provide actual content in write_file call - placeholders indicate missing content parameter"
)
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Messages (agent_runtime.py:824-829)
More descriptive error messages when content is missing:
```python
error_message = (
    f"write_file called without valid content for {file_path}\n"
    "CRITICAL: Content parameter is required and cannot be empty.\n"
    "The agent MUST provide the actual file content in the write_file call.\n"
    "Placeholder content will be generated but this indicates an error in the agent's behavior."
)
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Agents would call write_file without content repeatedly
- Placeholder files were generated silently
- Agents got stuck in retry loops
- Unclear error messages didn't guide agents to correct behavior

### After Fix
- Clear, actionable error messages guide agents to include content
- Explicit prompt instructions prevent the split-step pattern
- Warning-level logging makes issues more visible
- Examples in error messages show correct usage

## Verification Steps

1. **Monitor Session Logs**
   ```bash
   # Check for write_file errors
   grep "write_file called without content" sessions/*.json
   
   # Look for warning messages
   grep "WARNING: Generated placeholder" sessions/*.json
   ```

2. **Expected Behavior**
   - Agents should call write_file with both parameters
   - No repeated "Let me create the actual implementation" messages
   - Clear error guidance if content is missing
   - Agents should self-correct after receiving error feedback

3. **Success Indicators**
   - ✅ No placeholder files in final output
   - ✅ Single write_file call per file (not multiple attempts)
   - ✅ Content provided in first call
   - ✅ No retry loops for file creation

## Prevention Strategies

### For Agent Development
1. Always test agents with file creation tasks
2. Monitor for placeholder content generation
3. Ensure agents have sufficient context/token limits for large files
4. Use the Task tool for complex multi-file generations

### For System Monitoring
1. Alert on high frequency of placeholder generation
2. Track write_file success rates per agent
3. Monitor for repeated error patterns
4. Review session logs for stuck agents

## Related Systems

### Error Recovery Chain
The system still follows the 5-stage escalation:
1. Retry Same
2. Retry with Context (now includes better guidance)
3. Trigger Debugger
4. Alternative Agent
5. Manual Intervention

### MCP Integration
Agents should use `mcp_ref_search` to get file templates before creation, reducing the likelihood of missing content.

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: AI Specialist File Creation
```python
# Test that ai-specialist provides content
agent = "ai-specialist"
task = "Create a comprehensive AI service module"
# Should create file with actual content, not placeholder
```

### Test Case 2: Error Recovery
```python
# Simulate missing content
write_file(file_path="test.py")  # Missing content
# Should receive clear error guidance
# Agent should retry with content included
```

### Test Case 3: Large File Generation
```python
# Test with large content (>15KB as required by ai-specialist)
# Ensure agent doesn't try to split into multiple calls
```

## Conclusion

The fixes ensure that:
1. Agents receive clear, actionable feedback when content is missing
2. Prompt instructions prevent the split-step pattern
3. Logging clearly identifies when placeholder content is generated
4. Error recovery can properly guide agents to correct behavior

These changes should eliminate the repeated "Let me create the actual implementation file content separately" pattern and ensure agents provide complete file content in their write_file calls.
