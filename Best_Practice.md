Anthropic just revealed their internal prompt engineering template - here's how to 10x your Claude results
If you've ever wondered why some people get amazing outputs from Claude while yours feel generic, I've got news for you. Anthropic just shared their official prompt engineering template, and it's a game-changer.

After implementing this structure, my outputs went from "decent AI response" to "wait, did a human expert write this?"

Here's the exact structure Anthropic recommends:

<template>

1. Task Context
Start by clearly defining WHO the AI should be and WHAT role it's playing. Don't just say "write an email." Say "You're a senior marketing director writing to the CEO about Q4 strategy."

2. Tone Context
Specify the exact tone. "Professional but approachable" beats "be nice" every time. The more specific, the better the output.

3. Background Data/Documents/Images
Feed Claude relevant context. Annual reports, previous emails, style guides, whatever's relevant. Claude can process massive amounts of context and actually uses it.

4. Detailed Task Description & Rules
This is where most people fail. Don't just describe what you want; set boundaries and rules. "Never exceed 500 words," "Always cite sources," "Avoid technical jargon."

5. Examples
Show, don't just tell. Include 1-2 examples of what good looks like. This dramatically improves consistency.

6. Conversation History
If it's part of an ongoing task, include relevant previous exchanges. Claude doesn't remember between sessions, so context is crucial.

7. Immediate Task Description
After all that context, clearly state what you want RIGHT NOW. This focuses Claude's attention on the specific deliverable.

8. Thinking Step-by-Step
Add "Think about your answer first before responding" or "Take a deep breath and work through this systematically." This activates Claude's reasoning capabilities.

9. Output Formatting
Specify EXACTLY how you want the output structured. Use XML tags, markdown, bullet points, whatever you need. Be explicit.

10. Prefilled Response (Advanced)
Start Claude's response for them. This technique guides the output style and can dramatically improve quality.

Pro Tips
The Power of Specificity
Claude thrives on detail. "Write professionally" gives you corporate buzzwords. "Write like Paul Graham explaining something complex to a smart 15-year-old" gives you clarity and insight.

Layer Your Context
Think of it like an onion. General context first (who you are), then specific context (the task), then immediate context (what you need now). This hierarchy helps Claude prioritize information.

Rules Are Your Friend
Claude actually LOVES constraints. The more rules and boundaries you set, the more creative and focused the output becomes. Counterintuitive but true.

Examples Are Worth 1000 Instructions
One good example often replaces paragraphs of explanation. Claude is exceptional at pattern matching from examples.

The "Think First" Trick
Adding "Think about this before responding" or "Take a deep breath" isn't just placeholder text. It activates different processing patterns in Claude's neural network, leading to more thoughtful responses.

Why This Works So Well for Claude
Unlike other LLMs, Claude was specifically trained to:

Handle massive context windows - It can actually use all that background info you provide

Follow complex instructions - The more structured your prompt, the better it performs

Maintain consistency - Clear rules and examples help it stay on track

Reason through problems - The "think first" instruction leverages its chain-of-thought capabilities
