# DevPortfolio Integration Security Guidelines

## API Key and Secret Management
- Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Rotate secrets every 90 days
- Use key vault or secret management service

## Authentication Flows
### OAuth 2.0 Guidelines
- Always use HTTPS
- Implement state parameter for CSRF protection
- Store tokens securely with encryption
- Use short-lived access tokens
- Implement token refresh mechanism

## Webhook Security
- Always validate webhook signatures
- Implement IP whitelisting
- Use HMAC SHA-256 for signature verification
- Log and monitor webhook events
- Implement retry and dead-letter queue for failed webhooks

## Rate Limiting Strategy
- Implement exponential backoff for API failures
- Track and log rate limit errors
- Provide graceful degradation for service interruptions
- Use token bucket algorithm for fair request distribution

## Error Handling
- Never expose raw error messages to end-users
- Log errors with minimal sensitive information
- Implement comprehensive error tracking
- Provide user-friendly error responses

## Monitoring and Logging
- Track integration health and performance
- Monitor error rates and response times
- Set up alerts for critical failures
- Anonymize and protect user data in logs
