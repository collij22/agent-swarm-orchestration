## Milestone Schedule

### Milestone 1: Backend MVP (End of Hour 4)
- Authentication system functional
- Task CRUD operations complete
- AI integration working
- Database properly configured

### Milestone 2: Frontend MVP (End of Hour 7)
- React app fully functional
- All features accessible through UI
- AI features integrated
- Responsive design implemented

### Milestone 3: Production Ready (End of Hour 9)
- Full system testing complete
- Docker deployment working
- Documentation complete
- All success metrics met

## Resource Allocation

### Development Time Distribution
- Backend Development: 40% (3.5-4 hours)
- Frontend Development: 35% (3-3.5 hours)
- Integration & Testing: 15% (1.5 hours)
- Documentation & Deployment: 10% (1 hour)

### Budget Allocation
- OpenAI API Usage: $5-15 (development + testing)
- Development Tools: $0 (using free tiers)
- Deployment: $0 (local Docker)
- Buffer: $85-95 remaining

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Timeline Risks
- **Buffer Time**: Built-in 1-2 hour buffer for unexpected issues
- **Feature Prioritization**: Clear P0/P1/P2 priority system
- **Parallel Development**: Frontend can start once backend API is defined

### Technical Risks
- **AI API Limits**: Implement caching and request limiting
- **Database Performance**: Use SQLite with proper indexing
- **Frontend Complexity**: Keep UI simple, focus on functionality

### Quality Risks
- **Testing Time**: Automated testing where possible, focus on critical paths
- **Documentation**: Template-based documentation for speed
- **Deployment Issues**: Use proven Docker configurations

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Development Metrics
- [ ] All 10 core API endpoints functional
- [ ] AI categorization accuracy >80% on test cases
- [ ] Frontend loads and operates without errors
- [ ] Docker deployment successful

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] API response time <100ms (non-AI endpoints)
- [ ] AI processing time <2s per request
- [ ] Frontend initial load <3s
- [ ] Database queries optimized

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases
- [ ] Input validation prevents invalid data
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate

## Handoff Requirements

### To Project Architect
- Technical architecture decisions needed
- System design specifications required
- Integration patterns to be defined

### To Development Team
- Detailed implementation specifications
- API contracts and data models
- UI/UX requirements and mockups

### To DevOps/Deployment
- Docker configuration requirements
- Environment setup procedures
- Deployment verification steps

## Contingency Plans

### If Behind Schedule
1. Defer P2 features (advanced testing, rate limiting)
2. Simplify UI to basic functionality only
3. Reduce AI features to basic categorization only
4. Skip comprehensive documentation, focus on README

### If Technical Issues
1. Fallback to simpler AI integration (rule-based categorization)
2. Simplify authentication (basic username/password only)
3. Use mock data if database issues occur
4. Deploy without Docker if containerization fails

### If Budget Constraints
1. Limit AI API calls during development
2. Use cached responses for repeated testing
3. Implement request batching for efficiency
4. Monitor usage closely throughout development

This roadmap provides a structured approach to delivering the TaskManagerAPI MVP within the specified constraints while maintaining quality and functionality standards.
