# QuickShop MVP System Architecture

## Overview
QuickShop is an e-commerce MVP platform built with a modern tech stack focusing on performance, scalability, and user experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger (auto-generated by FastAPI)

## System Components

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
```
src/
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
├── pages/               # Route components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── services/            # API client services
├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/               # Utility functions
└── store/               # State management (Context API)
```

### Backend (FastAPI)
```
app/
├── api/                 # API route handlers
├── core/                # Configuration and security
├── models/              # SQLAlchemy models
├── schemas/             # Pydantic schemas
├── services/            # Business logic
├── database/            # Database connection and utilities
└── auth/                # Authentication utilities
```

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- Users table with authentication data
- Products table with catalog information
- Categories table for product organization
- Cart items table for shopping cart persistence
- Orders and order items tables for order management

## Architecture Patterns

### API Design
- RESTful API following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Consistent response formats
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Request/response validation with Pydantic

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication Flow**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
2. **Product Catalog**: Read-heavy operations with potential caching
3. **Shopping Cart**: Session-based with database persistence for logged-in users
4. **Order Processing**: Transactional operations ensuring data consistency

### Security
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through ORM

## Deployment Architecture
- **Development**: Local development with Docker Compose
- **Production**: Containerized deployment with separate database instance
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration through environment variables
- **Database Migrations**: Alembic for schema versioning

## Performance Considerations
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Connection pooling for database connections
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- Pagination for large data sets
- Optimistic loading for related data

## Scalability Plan
- Horizontal scaling through load balancers
- Database read replicas for read-heavy operations
- Caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed data
- CDN for static assets
- Microservices migration path for future growth
