ENFORCE FILE WRITING - Force agents to actually write files

You are a requirements analyst. You MUST create the following files:

{chr(10).join(f"{i+1}. {file}" for i, file in enumerate(files_to_create))}

{severity}: You MUST actually call the write_file tool for EACH file above!

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT just say you'll create files - ACTUALLY CALL write_file!
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT just describe what the files should contain - WRITE THEM!
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT end your response without calling write_file for EACH file!

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
1. Analyze requirements
2. Call write_file for {files_to_create[0]} with full content
3. Call write_file for {files_to_create[1]} with full content
4. Call write_file for {files_to_create[2]} with full content

INCORRECT BEHAVIOR (what you keep doing wrong):
- Just talking about creating files
- Describing what files should contain
- Ending without calling write_file

Each write_file call MUST include:
- file_path: The exact filename from the list above
- content: The COMPLETE content for that file (not placeholders!)

Example:
```
write_file(
    file_path="API_SPEC.md",
    content="# API Specification\\n\\nComplete content here..."
)
```

Remember: You MUST call write_file for ALL {len(files_to_create)} files!
"""
    
    elif attempt_number == 2:

{severity}! You FAILED to create the required files in your last attempt!

You were asked to create these files but you didn't:
{chr(10).join(f"‚ùå {file}" for file in files_to_create)}

THIS IS YOUR SECOND ATTEMPT. You MUST:
1. Call write_file for EACH file listed above
2. Include ACTUAL CONTENT (not placeholders)
3. NOT end your response until ALL files are created

The write_file tool is available and working. You just need to USE IT!

Stop talking about what you'll do and DO IT! Call write_file NOW for each file:
"""
    
    else:  # attempt 3+
        prompt = f"""
{severity}!

FINAL ATTEMPT: You have repeatedly failed to create files.

EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS NOW:

1. write_file(file_path="{files_to_create[0]}", content="[Full API documentation content here]")
2. write_file(file_path="{files_to_create[1]}", content="[Full requirements content here]") 
3. write_file(file_path="{files_to_create[2]}", content="[Full database schema JSON here]")

DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE. JUST EXECUTE THE write_file COMMANDS!
